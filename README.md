# Northcoders News

## Description

### Background

A frontend project created during my time on the [Northcoders Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/), which will utilize my backend project, also made during the bootcamp, to create a Reddit-style website.

You will be 'logged in' as a user by default, which will provide additional functionality, only accessible to logged in users, such as, the ability to post comments, delete comments (only those posted by the logged in user), and upvote and downvote articles.

I have provided links to my backend project below:
